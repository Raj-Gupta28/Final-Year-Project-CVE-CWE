# Final-Year-Project-CVE-CWE
This project deals with cybersecurity, specifically in vulnerability management and predictive analytics.


This project aims to enhance vulnerability management by using machine learning to predict and prioritize vulnerabilities before they are exploited. The system will identify the most critical vulnerabilities by analyzing historical data and vulnerability reports, enabling organizations to address potential threats proactively. This approach improves security and optimizes resource allocation, ensuring that the most dangerous vulnerabilities are tackled first.

Our Contribution:
  •⁠  ⁠Prioritization Framework: Development of a framework that prioritizes vulnerabilities based on their predicted impact, helping organizations focus on the most        critical threats.
  •⁠  ⁠Predictive Modeling: Contribution to the field of cybersecurity by introducing ML models specifically designed for predicting vulnerabilities.
  •⁠  ⁠Tool Development: Creation of a user-friendly tool that integrates prediction and prioritization, making it accessible to security professionals.
